🚀 Software Engineer Roadmap (Python Track, 2025 Edition)

The path toward becoming a Software Engineer for top technology companies such as Google and Microsoft and other FAANG-level firms  stands documented in this repository.

The organized roadmap features essential elements from basic learning to data structures  and algorithms and system design along with project work and interview preparation.


📌 Roadmap  Overview

🔹 Phase 1 – Foundations (Months 1–2)

Review elementary Python  elements which include basic programming syntax and loops together with functions and object-oriented programming concepts such as classes together  with inheritance and polymorphism and encapsulation.

Master exception handling techniques together with file management and library  usage.

Learn how to measure algorithm performance through time complexity analysis and space complexity evaluation.

Practice solving beginner  coding exercises on LeetCode which focus on Arrays and Strings.

🔹 Phase  2 – Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (Months 3–5)

Arrays, Strings, Linked  List, Stacks, Queues.

HashMaps together with Recursion and Backtracking.

The  study of Trees includes BST and Binary Trees and Tries as well as Graph traversal algorithms BFS and  DFS and Dijkstra and Union-Find.

Sorting, Searching, Greedy along with Dynamic Programming.

Core objective: Complete 200–300 LeetCode problems.

🔹 Phase  3 – System &amp; Software Engineering Basics (Months 6–7)

The study of OOP Design includes  SOLID principles and UML along with design patterns.

The database study includes SQL and NoSQL with  MongoDB and Redis and SQL features such as Joins and Indexing and Transactions.

The Operating System  study focuses on processes and threads alongside deadlock and memory management.

The networking study consists of TCP/IP  protocols together with HTTP and HTTPS protocols and DNS and REST APIs.

System Design fundamentals include knowledge of  load balancers together with caching mechanisms and sharding.

🔹 Phase 4 – Development Skills &amp; Projects (Months 8–10)**

Learning Git  and GitHub stands as a crucial requirement for developers during this phase. Students should create projects using  To-do app and Blog app which can be developed with Flask/Django frameworks. Building a chat application  and an e-commerce backend system represents further project development. Students should learn deployment techniques using AWS/GCP/Azure  and Docker platforms. Achieve the target of deploying no fewer than two project applications which reach medium complexity.


🔹 Phase 5 – Advanced Projects &amp; Open Source (Months 11–12)

Students should  develop a scalable application which includes authentication features and APIs along with database integration capabilities. Students should begin making  contributions to open-source projects. Students should develop their resumes by including three to four significant project  works.


🔹 Phase 6 – Competitive Programming &amp; Mock Interviews (Months 13–15)

Students  should dedicate time to practicing on LeetCode and Codeforces and AtCoder. Students should participate in  weekly contests and conduct mock interviews through Pramp and Interviewing.io platforms. Students should focus on reviewing  DSA and system design concepts.



🔹 Phase 7 – Final Prep &amp; Applications (Months 16–18)

Students need to prepare behavioral answers following the STAR method for their interviews. Students should update their  resume and LinkedIn profile to reflect their current skills and experience. Students should begin submitting their applications to  Google and Microsoft and additional top-tier organizations

My experience getting ready for software developer interviews is documented in this repository. It consists of:

🧠 C++ Programming with Data Structures & Algorithms: Dedicated to understanding fundamental ideas, resolving DSA issues, and putting effective solutions into practice.

🐍 Python Projects: These are small to medium-sized projects that demonstrate problem-solving, useful applications, and clean coding techniques.

I'm constantly improving this repository as I hone my software development abilities and prepare for interviews. Suggestions and comments are welcome!
